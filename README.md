A preliminary assessment of water quality in silvopastoral systems of Panama’s dry tropical forest.

Dry tropical forests are unique, biodiverse ecosystems threatened by human development, 
especially deforestation for agricultural land use. Deforestation reduces carbon sequestration in 
landscapes and in turn, pollutes nearby waterways. Agroforestry practices, like silvopastoralism, 
can mitigate these impacts by integrating trees into working landscapes, but their effect on 
stream water quality has not been studied. We assessed the stream condition on five silvopastoral 
farms in Panama’s Azuero Peninsula by utilizing aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators. We 
collected aquatic macroinvertebrates and calculated the percent EPT, Diptera, and Odonata. 
Using ArcGIS, we measured distance to live fence, riparian connectivity, and forest patch size. 
We also measured tree carbon stored in the riparian area and throughout each farm. We analyzed 
the relationships between landscape or habitat variables and water quality scores using single 
linear regressions in R Studio. Percent EPT, Odonata, and diversity were positively predicted by 
riparian tree carbon, while percent Diptera was negatively predicted by riparian tree carbon. Our 
results highlight the importance of expanding agroforestry in this region and suggest that 
increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes may be beneficial to stream condition, but 
additional research is needed.
